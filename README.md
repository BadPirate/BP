BP
==

Collection of iOS utility classes and helpers that I have found I've needed again and again.

* BPFetchResultTVC - A basic implementation of UITableViewController that interacts with a FetchedResultController (Core Data)
* BPSimpleTVC - Allows for rapid building of UITableViews without having to setup all the cruft.  Create Sections / Rows, and assign rows click and load actions.
* NSString+BP - Category on NSString that aids in a few things that iOS left out (URLEncoding, Creating GET parameter style URL's, validating emails)
* UIActionSheet+BP / UIAlertView+BP - Categories that allow you to create alert views / action sheets that don't need a delegate (blocks rock), much cleaner.
